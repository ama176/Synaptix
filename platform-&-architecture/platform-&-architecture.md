# Platform & Architecture

At the core of Synaptix lies a multi-layered architecture engineered to support low-latency gameplay, instant transactions, and a robust reward distribution model. Our backend is powered by Solana, a high-performance blockchain capable of 65,000 transactions per second, ensuring zero lag even during peak usage.

**System Components:**
- **Smart Contract Layer:** Handles player interactions, SOL payouts, and NFT issuance. Written in Rust and deployed with upgradeable patterns for future-proofing.
- **Game Interface Layer:** Lightweight wrappers for Unity, Phaser, and WebGL that allow games to plug directly into our reward mechanics.
- **API Gateway:** Authenticates players, connects wallets, and handles matchmaking services. Offers REST and GraphQL endpoints for easy integration.
- **Leaderboard Engine:** Decentralized result validation powered by off-chain oracles and on-chain verification.

**Security Features:**
- Transaction signature validation
- Role-based access control for dev tools
- IPFS-based asset storage
- SLA-backed node uptime with redundancy

From matchmaking to payout distribution, every interaction is designed to be traceable, fast, and immutable. We are not just building a game launcher—we’re architecting the infrastructure for a new gaming economy.
