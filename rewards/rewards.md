# Rewards

Synaptix offers a multi-dimensional reward model that supports various player archetypes—casual gamers, hardcore competitors, explorers, and even content creators. Rewards are distributed primarily in SOL, but we also introduce soft currencies and NFTs for advanced players and collectors.

**Reward Channels:**
- **PvP Competitions:** Weekly and monthly prize pools distributed based on rank and match volume.
- **Daily Quests:** Auto-updating objectives with consistent rewards.
- **Streak Bonuses:** Earn more by playing consistently across multiple days.
- **Guild & Team Quests:** Cooperative mechanics that foster social engagement.

**NFT Boosts:**
Our system supports equipable NFTs (skins, items, badges) that boost performance or increase reward multipliers. Players can buy, sell, or rent these items via the Synaptix NFT marketplace.

All rewards are governed by smart contracts and automatically distributed to linked wallets. Players maintain full ownership and can immediately transfer, hold, or spend their assets—no middlemen, no delays.
