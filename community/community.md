# Community

At Synaptix, community is not an afterthought—it’s the backbone of everything we build. Players contribute to our design process, game curation, feature rollout, and even governance.

**Ways to Participate:**
- Join community playtests and submit feedback for upcoming titles
- Compete in seasonal leaderboard contests and tournaments
- Apply for grants as a game developer or content creator
- Earn community badges and NFTs for engagement

We host monthly town halls, AMAs, and strategy calls open to all holders and players. Our Discord server also supports guilds and private forums for top-ranked competitors.
