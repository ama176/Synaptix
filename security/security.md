# Security

Synaptix treats security not as an afterthought, but as a foundational principle. We operate in a trust-minimized environment where users interact directly with blockchain logic, and therefore every line of code must meet the highest standards of security and efficiency.

To that end, we implement:
- **Formal Verification:** Our smart contracts undergo simulation testing to ensure logical consistency under thousands of potential attack vectors.
- **Audits & Pen Testing:** All deployed code is audited by third-party firms. We also run bi-annual penetration tests with bug bounty incentives.
- **Zero Custody:** Synaptix never holds player assets. All assets and tokens reside within user-controlled wallets, accessible only via cryptographic authentication.
- **Anti-Exploit Systems:** Our backend includes heuristic models to detect bot behavior, rapid replays, and reward farming patterns. Suspicious activity is flagged and reviewed in real-time.

Additionally, we maintain transparent version logs for all smart contract updates and deploy governance-based controls to ensure no single entity can alter core mechanics unilaterally. This is how we secure not just dataâ€”but trust.
